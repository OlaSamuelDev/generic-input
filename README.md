## Potential improvements
- Allow classNames to be passed as props into the component to give full control over styling.
- Allow mask key and mask timing to be configurable through props.
- Allow caret flashing speed and color to be customizable through props.
- Allow empty input validation to be turned off through prop.
- Add JEST unit tests for the components and Util function.
- Currently the setCaretPosition uses a hardcoded font size and family. This should be dynamic based on the current text.

# Getting Started with Generic Input

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.
